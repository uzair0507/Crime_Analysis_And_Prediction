# Crime_Analysis_And_Prediction
My Final Year Project which employs Data Mining Techniques to handle and sort through the data to predict whether the given area is crime-free or not.
### Pre Requisites for running the project.
* OS -> Windows 10, Ubuntu v21, macOS v10.
* Memory -> Minimum 4 Gigabytes of RAM.
* Processor -> Minimum Quad-Core processor is required.
* Anaconda Distribution or Google Colab to run the code, but Anaconda is preferred.
* Anaconda Jupyter Notebooks are much preferred.
## Steps to run the project.
1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt in the project directory that is saved locally after downloading the project.
3. Give the ``` jupyter notebook ``` command in the prompt for the folder to open online in the jupyter kernel provided by Anaconda.
4. The Project is divided into three modules.
5. Open module1 and run it on the Jupyter Kernel
6. After the completion of module1 go back to the Anaconda Terminal and execute ``` python module2.py ```.
7. Then after the completion of module2, repeat again by going back to terminal and execute ``` python module3.py ```.
8. It will jump back to a simple web interface where a user can open a test file from the "Testing" directory where there are pre-loaded testing sets and choose anyone from the set to show the final result of the project.
